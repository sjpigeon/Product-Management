	<h1>Secrets Management</h1>
	<p>The customer requested feature was means to create a standard across the enterprise for storing secrets such as application credentials. After an extensive cost/benefit analysis, the development team and customer chose to use AWS Parameter Store as the repository for secrets.  
	
	<br>
	<h2>Business Case:</h2>
		
	<p><i>What is the customer's strategic benefit?</i>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Corporate Secrets (API keys, passwords, credentials) are intangible assets that must be managed just like any other nonphysical resource (copyrights, trademarks and patents): with tools to efficiently and effectively manage their use.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><i>What is the problem being solved?</i>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>The customer does not have a standardized, supported secret store solution to facilitate CI/CD. While a Vault solution was stood-up earlier this year to provide some capability, it is not in a supported state (old AMI, uses MongoDB), requires a costly integration to enable GTS support and has seen limited use. </li>
	</ul>

	<p><i>How will the customer benefit?</i>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Standardizing on a secret store solution, or solutions, enables application teams to more quickly implement and utilize CI / CD.</li>
	</ul> 

	<p><i>What is the capability?</i>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Secrets are kept in a central, managed store that's available for applications in Prod and non-Prod environments, enabling Best Practices, meeting Enterprise needs (application teams, Security Team) and scales with the customer.</li>

	<li>Secrets are kept in a central, managed store that's available for applications in Prod and non-Prod environments. </li>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Enables Best Practices, such as key rotation</li>
	<li>Meets Security Team requirements</li>
	<li>Scales with customer at a sustainable cost</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Secret store solutions that fit the needs of the application.</li>
	<ul class="b">	
	<li>API Keys</li>
	<li>Certificates</li>
	<li>Credentials/passwords</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Secrets can be abstracted from the application itself.</li>
	</ul>
	</ul>
	
	<p><i>What are we doing?</i>
	<ul class="b">	
	<li>Publish GoLang library and associated sample code for integration with customers application.</li>
	<li>Create and publish documentation to enable adoption </li>
	<ul class="b">
	<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/the-right-way-to-store-secrets-using-parameter-store/">The Right Way to Store Secrets in AWS Parameter Store</a></li>	
	</ul>	
	</ul>
	
	<p><i>How are we doing it?</i>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>The development team will collaborate with Stakeholders, Security Team and application team to document and publish the Secrets Management Program.</li>
	<li>Publish documentation on Confluence.</li>
	<li>Publish sample code and usage documentation on Confluence</li>
	</ul>
		
	<br>
	<h2>Solutioning:</h2>
	<p><i>Problem Statements(Prioritized)</i>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Application teams store secrets in non-secure, non-standard locations.</li>
	<li>Vault (current secrets system) is unwieldy (see above) and expensive to operate.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><i>Requirements/Scenarios(Prioritized)</i>	
	<ul class="b">
	<li>A defined program that maintains the integrity and confidentiallity of secrets (not giving everyone Admin perms for self-service) <em>**DONE** documented on Confluence.</em></li>
	<li>Define roles:</li>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Service Role - usage of actual secret by application <em>**DONE** application Service Task must use IAM Role to access Parameter Store.</em></li>
	<li>Engineer who creates the actual secret <em>**DONE** engineer assumes an AWS Role to create the secret in Parameter Store.</em></li>
	<li>Application Developer who uses the secret in the application code <em>**DONE** the only action is to <b>not</b> provide the developer a Role to assume that has access to Parameter Store.</em></li>
	</ul>
	<li>Abstract credentials from development <em>**DONE** via Role assumption and internal team process.</em></li>
	<li>Enable rotation <em>**DONE** via Policy.</em></li>
	<li>Don't require application redeployment to update secrets <em>**DONE** via the GoLang library and the application Service Task.</em></li>
	<li>Revoke access to secrets via a centrally managed system <em>**DONE** revoke access to AWS.</em></li>
	<li>Enable logging <em>**DONE** via CloudTrail.</em> </li>
	</ul>	
	
	<p><i>Solution Design</i>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Use run-time parameter resolution as part of a service via Docker container init script which pulls parameters (secrets) from AWS Parameter Store at runtime, export them into the container's environment and launch a service as PID 1.</li>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Deploy-time stores credentials in plain-text in the task definition. AWS CloudWatch full task definitions are logged, therefore, credentials are viewable in AWS logs. Deploy and credentials are tightly coupled, requiring a redeployment to change credentials</li>
	<li>Build-time exposes credentials in plain-text. May require per-environment imagess. </li>
	<li>The Parameter Store integration is controlled by environment variables passed into the Docker run command/ECS task definition.</li>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Set the variable PS_KEY_PATHS to a path in Parameter Store that contains the variables intended for export to the container environment. 
	</ul>
	<li>The Service Task must have IAM permissions/policy to ready parameters from the specified paths.</li>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>ssm:DescribeParameters</li>
	<li>ssm:GetParametersByPath</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Agile:</h2>	
		
	<p><b>Narrative</b> - As an application team, I need a secret management solution to store secrets so that I have an easy way to manage secrets across account demarcation boundaries.</p>
	
	<p><b>Requirements:</b></p> 
	<ul class="b">
	<li>GoLang INIT script with APK distributable</li>
	<li>The script pulls/fetches info from Parameter Store</li>
	<li>The script decrypts using KMS</li>
	<li>Create documentation:</li>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Create Task/Service Role and associated IAM Policy</li>
	<li>Enable the Task/Service Role to decrypt Parameter Store secrets</li>
	<li>Store Parameter Store info in local CONF file</li>
	<li>Start Task/Service after CONF file has been create and is available for use by the Service</li>
	<li>Successfully run the DataDogIntegrationRole script on each existing AWS account.</li>
	
	</ul>
	</ul>	

	<p><b>Acceptance Criteria:</b></p>
	<ul class="b">
	<li>Documentation fulfills all listed requirements.</li>
	<li>Documentation is peer reviewed.</li>
	<li>Automated test have been created and run on INIT script</li>
	<li>An early adopter team has successfully used the INIT script and provided actionable feedback (if any).</li>
	</ul>
