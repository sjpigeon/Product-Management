				<p>This is a collection of Product Management processes/tools I've had success with and a few recent deliverables.</p>
				
				<h2>Tools/Processes:</h2>
				
				<p><a href="templates.html">Templates</a> contain a model that I've found helpful for generating useful information for a feature, specifically defining and publishing the 'how', 'why' and 'what' context relevent to the customer(s) and development team alike.</p>
				
				<p>Agile methodologies/processes, particularly Scrum, are time multipliers for a trained team. Learn and follow the processes and don't accept unicorn responses.</p>
												
				<h2>Deliverables:</h2>
				
				<p><a href="monitoring.html">Monitoring</a>- As an application team, I need an automated solution that enables monitoring of cloud-based resources so that I'm enabled to create custom dashboards, reports and alerts and respond in a way that reflects the needs of my customer.</p>
				
				<p><a href="/secrets-management.html">Secrets Management</a> - As an engineer developing an application for the CI / CD Pipeline, I want a secret management solution to store secrets so that I have an easy way to manage secrets across account demarcation boundaries. As an Operations stakeholder I want the ability to change account passwords and keys without having to engage development or devops personal or executing the CI/CD Pipeline so that we can maintain a strong security presence and best practices.</p>
	
				<p><a href="/blue-green-deployment.html">Blue-Green Deployment</a> - As a application developer, I want Blue/Green Deployment capabilities so that I can manage application deployments with greater risk mitigation's for potential application issues.</p>
