	<h1>Templates</h1>
	<p>The Business Case and Solution Templates are intended to aid the Product Manager, customer and development team with feature definition by providing structure via the templates. This structure enables active communication, defining and publishing the 'how', 'what' and 'why' context that is relevent to all.</p>  
	
	<br>
	<h2>Business Case:</h2>
		
	<p><i>What is the customer's strategic benefit?</i>
	<ul>The 'why' for the customer: 1-3 lines of text that is intuitive enough for stakeholders to readily develop an understanding of the benefit in short order.</ul></p>

	<p><i>What is the problem being solved?</i>
	<ul>The 'why' for the development team:  1-3 lines of text that presents the root-cause(s)/gap(s)/shortcoming(s) to be addressed.</ul></p>

	<p><i>How will the customer benefit?</i>
	<ul>The 'how' for the customer: an enumerated list of benefits, or value, that the customer sees with the feature. This effectively addresses the problems being solved while providing a high-level reference to the capabilities.</ul></p> 

	<p><i>What is the capability?</i>
	<ul>The 'what' for the customer: an enumerated list of what the customer can do with the feature.</ul><p>
	
	<p><i>What are we doing?</i>
	<ul>The 'what' for the development team: an enumerated list of what will be built to enable capabilities for the customer.</ul></p>
	
	<p><i>How are we doing it?</i>
	<ul>The 'how' for the development team: an enumerated list of Stories that contain the implementation details.</ul></p>

	<br>
	<h2>Solutioning:</h2>
	
	<p><i>Problem Statements(Prioritized):</i>
	<ul>The prioritized details behind the 'problem to be solved' from the Business Case template. In the case of a major enhancement to an existing feature, this should include a comparison of expected (enhancement) behavior and actual/current feature behavior. </ul></p>
	
	<p><i>Requirements/Scenarios(Prioritized):</i>
	<ul>The prioritized details behind the 'capabilities' from the Business Case template.</ul></p>
	
	<p><i>Solution Design/Workflow:</i>
	<ul>Text and diagrams behind the 'what are we doing' and 'how are we doing it' from the development team.</ul></p>
