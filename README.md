### This is my collection of Product Management tools/process and recent deliverables. While the content published may not be transferable, the process/templates are.

##Tools/Process: The Business Case and Solution 'templates' are intended to aid the customer, Product Manager and development team with considering features by providing structure via templates. This structure provides active communication, defining and publishing the 'how', 'why' and 'what' context relevent to all stakeholders.

## Business Case 'template':
What is the customer's strategic benefit?
Tis is the 'why' for the customer: 1-3 lines of text that is intuitive enough for stakeholders to readily develop an understanding of the benefit in short order.

What is the problem being solved?
This is the 'why' for the development team:  1-3 lines of text that presents the root-cause(s)/gap(s)/shortcoming(s) to be addressed.

How will the customer benefit?
The 'how' for the customer: an enumerated list of benefits, or value, that the customer sees with the feature. This effectively addresses the problems being solved while providing a high-level reference to the capabilities.

What is the capability?
The 'what' for the customer: an enumerated list of what the customer can do with the feature.

What are we doing?
The 'we' is the developement team and the 'what' is for them: an enumerated list of what will be built to enable capabilities for the customer.

How are we doing it?
The 'we' is the developement team and the 'what' is for them: an enumerated list of Stories that contain the implementation details.


##Solutioning 'template':

Problem Statements (Prioritized):
The prioritized details behind the 'problem to be solved' from the Business Case template. In the case of a major enhancement to an existing feature, this should include a comparison of expected (enhancement) behavior and actual/current feature behavior.

Requirements/Scenarios(Prioritized):
The prioritized details behind the 'capabilities' from the Business Case template.

Solution Design/Workflow:
Text and diagrams behind the 'what are we doing' and 'how are we doing it' from the development team.


Requirements/Scenarios(Prioritized):

[Monitoring](https://github.io/sjpigeon/Product-Management/Monitoring.md)

- As an application team, I need an automated solution that enables monitoring of cloud-based resources so that I'm enabled to create custom dashboards, reports and alerts and respond in a way that reflects the needs of my customer.
